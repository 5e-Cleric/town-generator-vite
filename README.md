# townGenerator by 5e-Cleric

Hi, 5e-Cleric here, with an interesting project.

This comes from me wondering if i could do a town generator, like watabou's (https://watabou.itch.io/).

The algorithm takes 2d noise, simplifies de data, creates voronoi polygons based on that, and uses that as streets and to generate houses. All drawn in a canvas.

I moved this from my own [townGenerator](https://github.com/5e-Cleric/townGenerator) into react + vite for further development.
